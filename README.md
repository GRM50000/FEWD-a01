FEWD Assignment 1

## Gary Reid Music - 12 years as a Busker.
Twelve years ago this week **(Feb 2011)** on Waikiki Beach, I started playing music on the street *"busking"* after leaving my girlfriend to keep my sanity. To make a long story short, the last hint to run was when she told me how she wrote The Bible for me.
Anyway, one night after grabbing a soda from the ABC Convenience Store, I sat down with my guitar, tuned up, and as soon as I strummed an "E" Chord, a passerby tossed 45 cents at my guitar case. From there, a long career was born.

## GRM50000 - My Emerging _Alter-Ego_.
For a few different compartments of my life, I go by the screenname / pseudonym _**GRM50000**_. 
These tasks include, but aren't limited to:
* Web Design
* Fiction Writing 
* Techno Beats 

> "I'm thoroughly enjoying this class." - *Gary Reid* 

Here's a picture of me street performing in San Diego:
